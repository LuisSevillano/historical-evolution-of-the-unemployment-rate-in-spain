# Historical evolution of the unemployment rate in Spain

Mirror of an [old project](https://www.elmundo.es/grafico/economia/2014/10/24/544a3a98268e3ece028b456d.html) published on [elmundo.es](https://www.elmundo.es/) spanish
newspaper.  
It was my first project realized with d3js. It is not responsive and I don't want to look into it :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.

But from time to time people ask for their code as I've a video about its performance on Youtube. So I created this repository to keep these old files.
